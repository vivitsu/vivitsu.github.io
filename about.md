You've reached the personal homepage of Vivitsu Maharaja. I'm a programmer working at Amazon Web Services, on the AWS WorkDocs team.

I grew up in India, where I spent the first 23 years of my life. After acquiring a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Communication, and a short stint as an Embedded Engineer, I moved to the US in mid 2012 for graduate school. In 2014, I graduated from the University of Florida with a Master of Science in Computer Engineering, and have been working as a software engineer ever since.

Professionally, I've worked in a few different areas of software engineering. My first stint after undergrad was an Embedded Engineer, where I got to mess around with assembly programming and driver development. More recently, I've worked on the infrastructure side of things. I was in the San Francisco from late 2014 to mid 2016 (Taqueria Cancun, anyone?), and in that time, I've worked on:

- Hadoop pipelines that crunch sensor data
- Building and writing ETL pipelines
- Building a web service that does document processing
  - Specifically, it runs an OCR engine on the document, and outputs metadata that clients can consume to annotate documents and extract information from them easily

Since August 2016, I've moved to Seattle to join Amazon as part of the AWS WorkDocs team. AWS WorkDocs in an enterprise storage and collaboration platform, and I work there as a full stack engineer, working on both the client and service side of things.

In my spare time, I like to do photography, learn new programming languages (currently: [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) & [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)), or hack on some side project. I used to be an avid reader, but I seem to have lost the habit, and I am in the process of getting back into reading again.
